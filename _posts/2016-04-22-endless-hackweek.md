> Last year, all fired up from an [Eric Ries talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YepH-QiRaAA0), I pitched [Gabriel](https://civisanalytics.com/team/gabriel-burt/) on a radical idea. “What if we had hackweek every week?” The results have been exciting: we’ve produced internal tools that we use every day, released new features that went right into production, contributed new code to the open-source community, squashed of some of Tech’s least favorite bugs, and even prototyped major technical projects that made their way into the development queue and been staffed with large teams.
