Trevor Austin is a Technical Lead at Civis Analytics, where his team converts data science workflows into reusable software products.

Before joining Civis, Trevor battled identity theft at the IRS and ran data-driven gang interventions at the NYPD with Palantir Technologies. His 2009 startup Udorse aimed to democratize product sponsorship, and he pioneered the field of Low-Frequency Trading at Clarium Capital Management with the world’s slowest quant book, which traded monthly.

Trevor is a graduate of Harvard Law School, where he met his lovely wife and where he wrote the musical comedy Harry Issue Spotter and the Goblet of Breyer, which opened to rave reviews in Pound Hall.

Originally from San Diego, he has abandoned the beach in favor of bigger cities and four seasons, and currently lives on Chicago’s South side. He enjoys Southern cooking, follows public affairs obsessively, and still yells “objection!” at old episodes of Law and Order.
